# HTTP [two] is a (binary) protocol
# THHP [one] is a (textual) protocol

# Binary data or ones and zeroes is a far more compact way of transferring data, and it greatly reduces
# the chance of errors during data transfer.
# Secondly, HTP to compress its response headers, which again reduces transfer time.

# HTTP two uses persistent connections.
# And those persistent connections are also multiplexed, meaning that multiple assets such as stylesheets,
# scripts and HTML can be combined into a single stream of binary data and transmitted over a single connection

# HTTP one, of course, requiring a dedicated connection for each resource.

# Steps
#######
# 1- You need to add module : [--with_http_v2_module ] to ./configure command  

# 2- create certificates from a vendor or a service such as Let's Encrypt.
  # The following command to create self signed certificates and private key:
    # mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
    # openssl req -x509 -days 10 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self.crt
    #  
user www-data;
